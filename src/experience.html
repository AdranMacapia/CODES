            I think the most embarrassing experience in my life is when my family went always to the baclaran church every sunday and after that we gonna eat, also we are gonna shopping or stay from the place we went through. I was 13 or 14 years old up when that embarrassing experience happened so here's what happened not just me but many others have experienced this, so we ride a taxi or jeep to baclaran church and then we walked to the church but while walking to the church I saw many people walking too then accidently happened this embarrasing experience in my life is that while walking at so many people I forget to look my family in my side so when I touch the hand of a guy in my side I thought It was my brother but suddenly he removed my hand to his hand and then when I look to his face It was not my brother then I was Shocked and said sorry. After that, I need to find my family before they get away from me and yes I found it in first was so nervous because I thought Im gonna lost from my family and I was laugh when I realized that Embarrasing Experience in my life.

            I experience a lot of that sometimes I shouldered other people etc. but sometimes I experience people who experience that because that people always high-five me or sometimes whack my nape that caused me angry like i didn't recognize him to be my friend so I was angry but suddenly he said sorry. I have Many Embarrasing Experienced in my life like this or like going to cr after I ate or maybe at the middle of eating so that its embarrasing and poop stinks so they will smell like hell. Others embarrasing Experienced to my life is I don't remember maybe all of us have embarrasing experience that they will not forgot.

            I think my whole life was funny because I'am a kind of person who loves to joke at all maybe not a day goes by that I don't laugh, I don't know but I love to be happy everyday because this kind of thing makes me feel comfortable, I feel I have no problems, stress, or anything in my body just happy. I want my surroundings to be happy person or not thinking problems, When I go to my friends I'am the one gives laugh to our bondings I always do more talk jokes or maybe I troll dancing to be have fun, also when my friends broken or something I always make them smile and forget the problems. I have problems too but I choose to be happy always and in our house, me and my family always having a jokes or prank, we have also our problems into the house but sometimes we forgot that problems then we are gonna do have fun to forget those problems.

            I can't remember any funny experienced in my life because its so many experienced to my life, I think I remember last year its the vlog that we make to the fieldtrip for our subject I remember that I edited our video and that was so funny because I dance in the bus and in the place we go fieldtrip the title of that song is "Ang Mga Ibon" that was so lit and I can't stop laughing on the video or myself. I can't remember anything but I have the best life for me and I'm happy for that, I wan't the people to be happy always and be the version of yourself.

            My Saddest Experience is to my family I think it is the saddest experience of my life, so maybe I'm the kind of person who always choose to be happy because of what I experience. I experience this kind of being alone a lot in my family I feel I'm others sometimes they didn't asking me to be join by their food, sometimes they call me if they are needed someone who will do the house chores, So many problems it always start from the family. Maybe, I'm always choose to be happy because I dont want myself be eaten by sadness I want myself to be better always and focus on my study to make my dreams come true, also to have a happy life and the end.

        <p align="justify" style="font-size: x-large;">
            I feel sometimes when I go out from the house I feel Happy then when I go home I feel sad, maybe in the outside I didn't feel or think my problems because I always make have fun outside to be happy and forgot all those problem and I always hangouts to my friends to feel better. I always thankful who those help me in my sadness specially to my girlfriend who always cheer me up and help me with my problems, who always think im the best of all and always being positive at all she always chill me up when im angry, she always support me through thick and thin. To my family also im always thankful for that because of what I have today and they give all the best they can, also supporting me for all of my dreams even if they are the reason sometimes when I sad.
